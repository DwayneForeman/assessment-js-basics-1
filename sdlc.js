// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

// CORRECT ORDER BELOW:
// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration 
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "The Analysis of Requirements phase in the SDLC is the process of gathering, analyzing and documenting the requirements of the software system, to understand the problem and the needs of the users, and to create a detailed requirements document that serves as a blueprint for the design, development and testing phases."

const design = "The Design phase in the SDLC is the process of creating a detailed blueprint of the software system that defines the architecture, components, interfaces, and data structures based on the requirements gathered during the Analysis of Requirements phase."

const implementation = "The Implementation phase in the SDLC is the process of converting the design of the software system into a working system by writing code, integrating it with other components and preparing it for testing."

const testingAndIntegration = "The Testing & Integration phase in the SDLC is the process of validating the software system by executing a set of tests to ensure that it meets the requirements, identify and fix defects, and integrate different components of the system to ensure that they work together as expected."

const maintain = "The Maintain phase in the SDLC is the process of updating, modifying and maintaining the software system to fix bugs, improve performance, and add new features based on the feedback from users and changing business needs."
